                                                However, we often recommend our customers additional features with their lenses, depending on their personal requirements.
                                                When it comes to tints, we recommend Anti-reflective (anti- glare) coating for computer use and night time driving.
                                                High index- some prescriptions require very thick lenses; Using high index lens we can reduce the thickness and weight of the 
                                                lenses not altering the vision. Polycarbonate very strong lens, made from extra tough type of plastic; recommended for rimless

                                        <p> There are a few variations of the glaucoma test. The purpose of all of them is to measure the pressure inside your eye. 
                                            The most common glaucoma test is the "puff-of-air" test, technically known as the non-contact tonometer. 
                                            For this test, the optician will start by having you put your chin on the machine's chin rest. While you look at a light inside the machine, 
                                            the optician will line it up and puff a small burst of air at your open eye. 
                                            It is completely painless, and the tonometer does not come in contact with the eye. 
                                            Based on your eye's resistance to the puff of air, the machine calculates your intraocular pressure. 
                                            The whole test takes just a few seconds. Since glaucoma is often the result of an increase of pressure inside the eye, 
                                            it is a very important test for ensuring the long-term health of your eyes.!</p>

                                        <p>Anti-reflective or antireflection (AR) coatings are a type of optical coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical devices to reduce reflection. 
                                        This improves the efficiency of the system since less light is lost. The coating on eyeglass lenses makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others. 
                                        Opticians dispense "antireflection lenses" because the decreased reflection makes them look better, and they produce less glare, which is particularly 
                                        noticeable when driving at night or working in front of a computer monitor. The decreased glare means that wearers often find their eyes are less tired, 
                                        particularly at the end of the day. Allowing more light to pass through the lens also increases contrast and therefore increases visual acuity.</p>
